## Deep Q Network (DQN)
`Deep Q-Learning` (`Deep Q-Network`) is a `Reinforcement Learning` (`RL`) algorithm that combines the `classic Q-Learning` algorithm and `Deep Neural Networks`. This is my minimal Pytorch implementation of [Deep Q Network (DQN)](DQN). Refer to the original paper [Deep Q-Network (DQN)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602).

## Double Deep Q Network (Double DQN)
`Double Deep Q-Learning` is an improvement on the `Deep Q-Learning` algorithm, taking inspiration from [classic Double Q learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2010/file/091d584fced301b442654dd8c23b3fc9-Paper.pdf) to reduce the overestimation bias that `DQN` encounters. This is my minimal Pytorch implementation of [Double Deep Q Network (Double DQN)](DoubleDQN). Refer to the original paper [Double Deep Q-Network (Double_DQN)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461).
