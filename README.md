Reinforcement learning algorithms

# Introduction & Motivation
This project is minimal implementation of some RL algorithms. When I read new RL algorithms (especially after a long time without coding RL), I can't remember basic RL algorithms and take a lot of time to remember old algorithms. And many RL sources (Github, blog, paper) use different styles and variants of RL algorithms, which makes it hard to read. I implement some RL algorithms to remember and reuse my code when I want to learn and try something news.
